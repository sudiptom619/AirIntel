# Weights for livability score computation
# These weights sum to 1.0 and determine each component's contribution
weights:
  pollution: 0.30      # Air quality (PM2.5/PM10)
  traffic: 0.15        # Road density (higher = worse)
  industry: 0.15       # Distance to industrial (farther = better)
  green: 0.15          # NDVI vegetation (higher = better)
  population: 0.10     # Population density (lower = better)
  flood: 0.10          # Flood risk (lower = better)
  elev: 0.05           # Elevation factor

# Scoring thresholds and breakpoints
